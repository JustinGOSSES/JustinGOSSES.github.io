clone of wordpress page but static for testing purposes

From 2015-2022, my personal website was a WordPress site at justingosses.com. 

This repository holds a static clone of the site at two time periods (2019 & 2022) created with the WordPress Plugin "Simply-Static".

The latest of those two snapshots is visible as a github pages page at https://justingosses.github.io/ .
