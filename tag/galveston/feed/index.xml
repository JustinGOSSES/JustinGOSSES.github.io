				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>ArcGIS:</h4><p>For those that might be new to GIS, ArcGIS is the default enterprise GIS solution. This isn&#8217;t a great comparison, but it is similar to Microsoft in the 1990s but less evil and with no Apple. The company behind ArcGIS is ESRI. They provide a variety of geospatial products and services; ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Server, ArcGIS Online, etc. All of them do geospatial analysis, just differently. ArcGIS desktop is going to be what someone with &#8220;Geospatial Analyst&#8221; in their job title will be using on most days in a business setting. ArcGIS Server, as the name implies, is about supplying data to large organizations via a server. ArcGIS Online is geared to sharing maps through web maps and web apps.</p>
<h4>Web Map vs. Map App</h4><p>Before we go any further, let&#8217;s get some terminology out of the way. Using ArcGIS Online, you can build either a web map or a map app. A Web map, for our purposes, is going to be something you&#8217;re probably going to embed into your own website. It might have a zoom feature and a legend, but it won&#8217;t have too many bells and whistles. A map app by contrast is more like a stand alone web application that exists as a single page with its own url address. Think of it as its own website. ArcGIS Online has both a gallery of Map App themes to choose from and a Map App builder. If you&#8217;re familiar WordPress. It is almost like WordPress for maps. There are widgets for adding a measuring button, a search tab to find locations, image analysis, feature editing, and various other options.</p>
<h4>Comparison to Cartodb, Mapbox, etc.</h4><p>ArcGIS Online and the other online map services all try to be the service you use to easily embed maps in your webpage or share urls to your map on their site. ArcGIS online products have the advantage of the ESRI name, established support, and being one part of a wider enterprise solution.</p><p>For the purpose of this blog post (and as refresher before going to a GIS web development hackathon) I built a map using ArcGIS online, which is below. It was built with a small subset of the data I&#8217;m using for a map on Houston recreational paddling experiences. I also turned that map into a Map App.</p><p><b>The map app can be found at this <a href="https://gosses.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b432c7a82e8f4e42958df3f955f781e1" target="blank">link</a></b>, which will open another tab on your browser with a full page map app. In addition to opening up full screen,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the map app makes it possible to turn layers on and off, measure distance, get directions from your location to boat launches on the map, and brings the legend up as an option</span>.</p><p>My general impression was if all I needed was a really quick and simple map that only included a basemap and a few points, I&#8217;d probably go with Mapbox. The upload and selection of data is a little slower with ArcGIS Online. Plus, there are more buttons to push between start and finish. For very complicated maps, I suspect ArcGIS online would likely be what I&#8217;d use, because I could more easily build the map in desktop mode, where I&#8217;m not slowed by internet service and browser constraints, and then transition it online.</p><p><del>One disappointment I did have with ArcGIS online was the limited data types you were allowed to upload to your online map. In addition to limited data types, shape files couldn&#8217;t be above a certain size or number of features. I ended up having to dissolve every shapefile I uploaded, resulting in lost of attribute information I would have liked to be included in the map. Specifically, the names of small stream segments and stream environmental health information. As this was a quick trial map, I didn&#8217;t worry too much about it, but in the future I&#8217;ll likely have to use python to split shapefiles into many shapfiles by attribute criteria and then load up a larger total number of shapefiles. Doing it by hand would be too slower and annoying.</del>  <em> <strong>EDITED: </strong>It turns out I could upload it directly. I just needed to do it as a feature service instead of shape files. Thanks to Nick for the correction. </em></p><p>The best thing ArcGIS Online has going for it for putting very easy to moderate complexity maps on the web is the pre-built MapApp themes. Their <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/" target="blank">WebApp gallery</a> has a portfolio of some of standard themes and others that people have built. If you&#8217;re a full blown web developer you might choose to use leaflet.js and more general javascript to build these types of polished feature rich map applications. If you don&#8217;t know what javascript is, ArcGIS Online Web App builder might be your best option.</p><p><em><strong>EDIT:</strong> For more information on ArcGIS online development tools, check out this <a href="/arcgis_hackathon/" target="blank"> more recent post</a>.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is Mapbox?</h3><p>Mapbox is an online map service, like CartoDB, which was discussed in a previous post. The value proposition of this type of services is you get to add a nice looking map to your webpage including the zoom and pan features users expect, without having to mess with a full GIS program.</p>
<h5>First Impression Comparison to Other Options</h5><p>Compared to CartoDB, Mapbox seems to have a little bit more flexible and contains more features, which you can choose whether or not you use. It also has a javascript api similar to leaflet, which lets web or mobile developers create new maps on the fly based on user&#8217;s interactions within their own website. The additional options increase the level of fiddling around and exploring you end up doing, but don&#8217;t seem super distracting as Mapbox does a good job at keeping the extra options out of your way if you don&#8217;t want to use them.</p>
<h5>Favorite Feature</h5><p>I&#8217;ve not delved deep into every option yet, but one of my favorites was the ability to quickly change image characteristics like saturation, contrast, brightness, etc. The standard base maps imagery tends to be somewhat muted. There is good reasons for this. Often roads and layers that go over the basemap are what you want the users&#8217; eyes to go towards. With a geology background, however, there are times I want to see the variation of the natural features really pop. The map below is a good example of this. The original base map image provided didn&#8217;t show nearly as many interesting details, so I changed the image characteristics to bring out certain features.</p>
<h5>The Map Below</h5><p>The map below is a satellite image of Moody&#8217;s island in West Galveston bay. The area just to the west of this is sometimes called Christmas Bay. It is one of my favorite areas around Houston. The landscape around this area is in constant flux. Channels move. Sandy banks move. After a hurricane, the shoreline and houses built on it move. Variations in tides and river influx sometimes result in surprisingly clear water in which you can see jelly-fish, sting-rays, and hermit crabs.</p><p>The roofs are fishing shacks built on stilts. They can only be accessed by boat. The state doesn&#8217;t allow them to be built anymore, but they do allow the owners to maintain and use them following certain regulations.</p><p>The Houston area isn&#8217;t known for great outside recreation. Some people even assume there just isn&#8217;t any. To a certain extent they&#8217;re right, but then again there are lots of places like this with loads of wildlife and great scenery. They just take a shallow draft boat to get to, which isn&#8217;t that common. Plus, they&#8217;re not at all visible from the road, so, unlike mountains or canyons, people don&#8217;t necessary know they exist if they aren&#8217;t already out there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/jgosses/cii6llgu60000yglwxtzfikgm.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoiamdvc3NlcyIsImEiOiJjaWk2aWhua2kwMWxidDBrZndhbHBraTd1In0.IIT7dwztvQhH9ZsiOLmnMg#16/29.077755149795877/-95.14694250103663/0" width="100%" height="800">nothing appearing in iframe</iframe></p>
